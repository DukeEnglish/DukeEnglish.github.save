I was studying Information security in HUNAN Univerisity and Artificial Intelligence in the University of Edinburgh.
I am really interested in every aspect related with the applications of Artificial Intelligence. I admire that NLP is an interdisciplinary field, and to do interdiciplinary research, we need a discipline. Therefore, I look for collaborators from mathematics, machine learning, computer science, linguistic, and any other subjects. I don't expect you to be an expert in all of these firelds&mdash;few people are&mdash;but I do expect you to learn 
something about all of them from a diverse of group of collaborators.

This is a pretty interested idea.

<li>For a system to understand a text and answer questions about it, the 
system must distill the meaning of the text into a set of facts (semantic 
parsing). We can represent these facts as a graph: entities and events 
become nodes, and relationships between them become edges. We now have 
datasets that pair text with such graphs, and we'd like to learn a semantic 
parser from this data, so we need to model graphs. <b>How do
we design and use deep probabilistic models of graphs?</b></li>

<p>I'm interested in most things involving language, structure, and learning. 
If you are too, I invite to you contact me even if these projects aren't 
quite what you want. I'm happy to discuss alternatives. 

<h4>Academic seminar</h4>
<p>I currently hold a little private academic seminar with a few friends. If you are interested in this kind of activity, please get in touch, we could hold another one around WANGJING.
